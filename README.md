## Why This Matters for a SOC Analyst

Cybersecurity analysts are responsible for detecting, analyzing, and responding

risk, and security principles is essential before working with tools like SIEMs
and logs.

This repository represents my first step toward building practical cybersecurity
and SOC analyst skills.
